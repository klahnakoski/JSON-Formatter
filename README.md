JSON Formatter
==============

Simple static page that will format JSON

Overview
--------

Will format JSON in a dense but still readable way.  The major features are:

* Opening brace (`{`) is on same line as key
* Objects with only one key have key on same line 
* Lists are on single line, when it looks good that way

Let's Use It!
